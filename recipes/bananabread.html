            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a loaf pan
                    with enough butter to coat the bottom and sides.
                </li>
                Mix together the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar in a large bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put the stick of butter in a medium bowl and beat it with a whisk (or an
                    electric mixer) until creamy and fluffy. Beat in the eggs and bananas until well
                    combined. Stir this mixture intothe dry ingredients just enough to combine
                    everything. Gently fold in the vanilla and the nuts if you're using them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until it's
                    browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out almost
                    entirely clean. Cool the pan on a rack for 15 minutes, then carefully turn it upside
                    down to release the loaf. Serve warm or at room temperature (or wrap in plastic and
                    keep at room temperature for up to a couple days).
