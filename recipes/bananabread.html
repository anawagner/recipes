        <div class="instructions">
            <p><span class="step">1</span> Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a loaf pan with enough butter to coat
                the
                bottom and sides.
            </p>

            <p><span class="step">2</span> Mix together the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar in a large bowl.</p>

            <p><span class="step">3</span> Put the stick of butter in a medium bowl and beat it with a whisk (or an
                electric
                mixer) until creamy and fluffy. Beat in the eggs and bananas until well combined. Stir
                this mixture intothe dry ingredients just enough to combine everything. Gently fold
                in the vanilla and the nuts if you're using them.
            </p>

            <p><span class="step">4</span> Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until it's
                browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out almost
                entirely clean. Cool the pan on a rack for 15 minutes, then carefully turn it upside
                down to release the loaf. Serve warm or at room temperature (or wrap in plastic and
                keep at room temperature for up to a couple days).
