    <h1>Banana Bread</h1>
    <span>Time</span> About 1 hour
    <span>Makes</span> 1 loaf (8 to 12 servings)
    <ul>
        <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, softened, plus more for greasing the pan</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspooons baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3 very ripe bananas, mashed with a fork until smooth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <p>1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a loaf pan with enough butter to coat the 
        bottom and sides.
    </p>

    <p>2. Mix together the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar in a large bowl.</p>

    <p>3. Put the stick of butter in a medium bowl and beat it with a whisk (or an electric
        mixer) until creamy and fluffy. Beat in the eggs and bananas until well combined. Stir
        this mixture intothe dry ingredients just enough to combine everything. Gently fold
        in the vanilla and the nuts if you're using them. 
    </p>

    <p>4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until it's 
        browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out almost
        entirely clean. Cool the pan on a rack for 15 minutes, then carefully turn it upside
        down to release the loaf. Serve warm or at room temperature (or wrap in plastic and 
        keep at room temperature for up to a couple days).
