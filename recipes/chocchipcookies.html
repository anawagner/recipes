            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                1
Heat oven to 375°F. In small bowl, mix flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.
2
In large bowl, beat softened butter and sugars with electric mixer on medium speed, or mix with spoon about 1 minute or until fluffy, scraping side of bowl occasionally.
3
Beat in egg and vanilla until smooth. Stir in flour mixture just until blended (dough will be stiff). Stir in chocolate chips and nuts.
4
Onto ungreased cookie sheets, drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart.
5
Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown (centers will be soft). Cool 2 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Store covered in airtight container.
